- [x] StatusBar: Replaced reactive alert selectors with 3s polling — eliminates re-renders on every alert
- [x] Config Save: Increased debounce 500ms→2000ms — reduces file I/O contention

## Completed (v2.5.0 Zero-Wait SSH Input)
- [x] SSH write fire-and-forget: invoke() no longer awaited — zero IPC wait between keystrokes
- [x] Microtask batching: all keystrokes from same JS frame sent in one IPC call
- [x] Paste via writeQueue: Ctrl+V/right-click routes through same optimized path
- [x] Session timeout 20ms→10ms: reader thread processes writes 2x faster
- [x] Shared invokeRef: paste handlers use cached invoke instead of re-importing
- [x] TypeScript + Rust compilation verified

## Completed (v2.4.9 Bug Fixes — Audit Results)
- [x] Fix: UTF-8 split across read boundaries — incomplete sequences preserved for next read (SSH + PTY)
- [x] Fix: Navigation stack unbounded growth — capped at 50 entries per tab
- [x] Fix: History mismatch (500 memory / 100 persisted) — aligned to 200 both sides

- [x] Fix: SFTP partial file cleanup — incomplete downloads deleted on failure
- [x] Fix: Orphaned SSH sessions on navigation failure — disconnect + cleanup on error
- [x] TypeScript + Rust compilation verified

## Completed (v2.4.8 Final Polish — Re-render Elimination)
- [x] StatusBar: reduced from 15 to 8 reactive selectors (functions via getState, navStack memoized)
- [x] Write flush: queueMicrotask prevents recursive microtask buildup (SSHPanel + TerminalPanel x2)
- [x] Resize debounce: 80ms→50ms for snappier terminal resize (SSHPanel + TerminalPanel)
- [x] TypeScript + Rust compilation verified

## Completed (v2.4.7 Lock Elimination & Throughput)
- [x] SSH Reader: merged double lock into single lock scope (writes + EOF check + read in one acquire)
- [x] SSH Session timeout 50ms→20ms: aligned with flusher for faster write processing
- [x] SSH + PTY: UTF-8 fast path (str::from_utf8 → zero-alloc for 99% of data)
- [x] ssh_sessions: Mutex→RwLock: concurrent read access for ssh_write/ssh_resize (no serialization)
- [x] LogStream: 4KB→16KB buffer, batched output, no sleep polling
- [x] PTY buffer: 8KB→16KB: consistent with SSH, better throughput on large output
- [x] TypeScript + Rust compilation verified

## Completed (v2.4.6 Deep Performance Optimization)
- [x] SSH Write Queue: mpsc channel eliminates lock contention — IPC write is now instant (zero blocking)
- [x] SSH Reader Thread processes writes: all channel I/O in single thread, no Mutex contention with IPC
- [x] SSH Session timeout 100ms→50ms: reader loop iterates faster, writes processed sooner
- [x] SSH Error backoff 100-200ms→10-50ms: faster recovery from transient errors
- [x] SSH Max consecutive errors 50→15: faster dead connection detection
- [x] SSH Resize retry sleep 50ms→20ms, retries 5→3

- [x] Rust: main.rs — 9 new Tauri commands (start/stop hosting, join/leave, chat, permissions, kick, users)
- [x] Rust: Cargo.toml — tokio-tungstenite, futures-util, rand dependencies
- [x] Store: CollabSessionInfo, CollabUser, CollabChatMessage types
- [x] Store: 12 collab actions (host/join/leave/chat/permissions/kick/users)

- [x] CSS: terminal-instance flex layout for overlay support
- [x] TypeScript compilation verified

## Completed (v2.6.1 Bug Fixes)
- [x] Fix auto-update: separate download() from install(), use exit(0) so NSIS can replace files
- [x] Fix SSH handshake: configure_ssh_algorithms() with broad kex/hostkey/cipher/mac preferences before handshake
- [x] Fix SSH terminal black screen on reopen: double-resize trick to trigger SIGWINCH shell redraw
- [x] TypeScript + Rust compilation verified

## Completed (Paste fix nano/vim)
- [x] Fix paste into nano/vim adding extra spaces — replace manual `\x1b[200~...\x1b[201~` wrapping with `terminal.paste(text)` in SSHPanel.tsx and TerminalPanel.tsx (xterm.js handles BPM detection + CRLF→CR normalization)
- [x] Verified xterm.js 5.5.0 typings expose `paste(data)` and `bracketedPasteMode` mode tracking — fix is correct

## Completed (SSH old-connections dead-end fix)
- [x] Add `pendingSSHConnectId` + `requestSSHConnect()` + `clearPendingSSHConnect()` to appStore
- [x] SSHPanel: useEffect consumes `pendingSSHConnectId` and auto-triggers `startConnect` (opens password prompt for old saved connections without stored credentials)
- [x] TerminalPanel: when SSH-tab credentials are missing, route through `requestSSHConnect` instead of dead-ending with "Connect via SSH panel first"
- [x] TabBar: SSH-server quick-add menu now routes disconnected connections through `requestSSHConnect` instead of creating a broken tab
- [x] TypeScript compilation verified

## Completed (Deep audit pass 2 — verified bugs only)
- [x] HIGH (security): SFTP temp key file used `std::fs::remove_file` (recoverable from disk slack); replaced with `ssh_manager::secure_delete` (zero-overwrite) — `sftp_manager.rs:80`
- [x] HIGH (UX): SFTPPanel had the same encrypted-private-key silent-failure bug as SSHPanel; ported `isPassphraseError` + `isPassphrase` prompt mode + keychain pre-load to SFTPPanel
- [x] LOW (defense in depth): `log_manager::load_session`/`delete_session` only filtered `..`, `/`, `\` but didn't canonicalize. Added `safe_resolve()` helper that canonicalizes log_dir + canonicalizes the resolved path and verifies `starts_with(log_dir)` to defeat symlink-based escape
- [x] Made `secure_delete` `pub` in ssh_manager so sftp_manager can reuse it
- [x] TypeScript + Rust compilation verified clean

### False positives ruled out during the audit (do NOT re-flag in future)
- 10× "Zustand array mutation via `.length =`/`.splice()`" in appStore — all are on FRESH local arrays created with spread `[...]`, not on state. Safe.
- 4× "camelCase vs snake_case mismatch" in collab commands — Tauri 2 default behavior auto-converts `camelCase` JS args → `snake_case` Rust args. Safe.
- "saveWorkspace stale closure" — `get()` is synchronous, immediately followed by `set()`. No async gap. Safe.
- "SSHPanel:374 microtask stale activeSessionId" — closure correctly captures the activeSessionId from the effect that was active when the keystroke was queued; if user switches sessions, the IPC still goes to the correct session A in Rust. Safe.
- "PTY reader thread no join → zombie" — intentional. ConPTY blocks `read()` until master is dropped, which happens after `Drop::drop` returns. Documented and correct.
- "infra_monitor.rs:136 unwrap on systemctl parse" — actually `unwrap_or(trimmed)`, not `unwrap()`. Cannot panic.
- "collab failed_attempts TOCTOU" — cleanup and check are inside the SAME lock acquisition. Safe.
- "Sidebar interval stale closure" — effect deps `[sharedFolderIds]` recompute on folder add/remove, re-running effect with fresh closure.

## Completed (Bug-fix sweep — all HIGH/MED/LOW resolved)
- [x] HIGH: Encrypted private keys — added `isPassphrase` mode to passwordPrompt; `handleConnect` now detects libssh2 passphrase errors (passphrase/decrypt/extract/init/callback) and opens prompt; `startConnect` pre-loads stored passphrase from keychain for keyed connections
- [x] HIGH: `beforeunload` flush — pre-cache `cachedInvoke` during `loadConfig` (was only set after first save); reduced debounce 3000ms→800ms; new `flushAllPendingSync` flushes config + debug logs on `pagehide`/`beforeunload`/`visibilitychange`
- [x] MED: SSH session limit TOCTOU — added `ssh_in_flight: AtomicUsize` to AppState; `ssh_connect` reserves a slot via `fetch_add` BEFORE the handshake (RAII drop guard guarantees decrement on panic/error); final authoritative re-check inside the write-lock insert
- [x] LOW: Hard-coded session limits — extracted to `MAX_PTY_SESSIONS=50`, `MAX_SSH_SESSIONS=30`, `MAX_SFTP_SESSIONS=30` constants; PTY/SFTP now check limit BEFORE the slow spawn/handshake; error messages now tell users what to do ("Disconnect an existing session and try again")
- [x] TypeScript + Rust compilation verified clean

## Completed (SSH Lag Fix + Session Persistence)
- [x] SSH Lag: Treat libssh2 ErrorKind::Other timeout-like errors as idle (not transient with backoff)
- [x] SSH Lag: Reduced backoff for real transient errors from 20ms+ to 5ms+
- [x] SSH Scrollback: Added 64KB rolling scrollback buffer to SshSession (mirrors PTY pattern)
- [x] SSH Scrollback: Flusher thread + reader direct-emit paths all save to scrollback
- [x] SSH Scrollback: Added ssh_get_scrollback Tauri command
- [x] SSH Scrollback: SSHPanel restores scrollback when re-opening terminal for active session
- [x] Rust compilation verified (cargo check passed)
